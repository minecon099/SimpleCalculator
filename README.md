# SimpleCalculator
A simple Python Based Calculator that uses While and Elif functions
What you can do:
  - Remake the code (Upgrade it or just add new functions)
  - Add Suggestions (Im kinda up for comments so leave one if you think I could do it better!)
  - Share source code (Share it with everyone you want!)
What you can't do:
  - Use it for bad purposes (I don't like editing codes for bad, that is not good!)
  - Bad or Mean Suggestions (Commentaries are for suggestions or code discussion, I don't like arguing with people)
  
It is just a simple Program that uses some functions of python, im still on learning process so this is quite some of the first steps
of me as a beginner in python

It uses while functions and elif to identify 4 different types of operations and uses 0 to exit the program, and also leaves a couple
of data about my social media and other stuff

I recommend to use Visual Studio Community for this because python dosen't like a lot basic programs like just printing a message or 
loading limited loops

Have Fun <3
